# Mixmetica
## A simple mixin mod that adds Arcmetica support directly into OptiFine. No more need for DNS rules. Capes are temporarily not supported.

### Requires OptiFine to work. Recommended versions:

    1.8.9: M6 Pre2

### Have an issue? Mixmetica is an extremely simple mod that modifies OptiFine to redirect their cosmetic URLs to Arcmetica's. If you are experiencing an issue, it is most likely an issue with Cosmetica, and you should report it to them. There is also a possibility it is an OptiFine issue, in which case there is nothing you can do as OptiFine won't fix it and I don't plan on modifying OptiFine any further than this. If you are able to confirm it is a Mixmetica specific issue, or just not sure what the issue is at all, feel free to report it in my Discord server. Both mine and Cosmetica's discord links can be found above.
